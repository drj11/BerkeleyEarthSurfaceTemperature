This file is a plain text export of a portion of the temperature data contained in Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Analysis.

The associated dataset name is shown above, while this file should have the name

	site_flag_definitions.txt

For general information about this data product, please refer to the data set readme file: README.txt

The current file contains descriptions of the per site quality control and metadata flags.  The main temperature data, other secondary data, and related station metadata can be found in other files in the same directory and should be distributed together.

The columns contained in this file are as follows:

Flag ID: A unique integer identifying each source archive.

	Flag Description: A text description of the meaning of the flag.

The site information may be found in files of the form

	site_detail.txt
	site_complete_detail.txt

Only site flags actually in use in this dataset will appear below.  Site flag values should remain stable over time and retain the same meaning for all Berkeley temperature datasets.  If no content appears below, it is because no data flags are used in this dataset.
