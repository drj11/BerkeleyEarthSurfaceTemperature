This file is a plain text export of a portion of the temperature data contained in Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Analysis.

The associated dataset name is shown above, while this file should have the name

	data_flag_definitions.txt

For general information about this data product, please refer to the associated readme file: README.txt

The current file contains descriptions of the per datum flag codes.  These flags are used as indicators of how the data has been processed and any quality control issues that are known to be present.  Users of this dataset are advised to review the flags as a means of identifying problematic data which they may choose to eliminate before performing an analysis.  The main temperature data, other secondary data, and station metadata can be found in other files in the same directory and should be distributed together.

The columns contained in this file are as follows:

	Flag ID: A unique integer identifying each datum flag.

	Flag Description: A text description of the meaning of the flag.

The flag associations with data may be found in files named

	flags.txt

Only quality control flags actually in use in this dataset will appear below.  Flag values should remain stable over time and retain the same meaning for all Berkeley temperature datasets.  If no content appears below, it is because no data flags are used in this dataset.
