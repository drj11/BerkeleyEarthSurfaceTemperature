Data Formats

The Berkeley project collects temperature data and metadata from a variety of sources and attempts to represent it in a common format.  This information is primarily managed via a series of customized Matlab classes, and the data and source code to use this system has been made available by Berkeley Earth (though the proprietary restrictions on Matlab may limit its availability for some users).

To accommodate other users and formats, we have designed a system to represent all of our information via a series of text files.  The data is distributed across a variety of files.  A minimal user wishing to inspect temperature and location data will need to examine only two of these files.  However, to accommodate advanced users we provide additional files including a variety of quality control, sourcing, and additional metadata.

The most important files for new and casual users are highlighted with the indicator “***”.


General dataset files:

	***	README.txt: An overview file describing the nature of the dataset and the way the data is distributed across other files.  The current file you are reading is the README file.

	***	site_detail.txt: An accounting of the metadata associated with each site.  This file is suitable for most users but omits certain metadata only available in the complete file.

		site_complete_detail.txt: Comprehensive collection of site metadata.  This file provides all available metadata including historical and conflicting values.  In order to represent all of the possible information, the format of this data file is the most complicated, and consequently this file is probably not of interest to casual data users.

		site_flags.txt: A variable length set of integer flags attached to each site indicating specifying additional characteristics of the site and the data attached to it.

		site_flag_descriptions.txt: Plain text descriptions of the site flags.

		data_flag_descriptions.txt: Plain text descriptions of the per datum flags.

		source_flag_descriptions.txt: Plain text descriptions of the source codes.

		station_changes.txt: A file highlighting the times at which changes in station metadata have occurred.


Per data type files:

	***	data.txt: File containing the temperature time series associated with this dataset.  This file also contains a limited amount of per datum metadata.

		flags.txt: File containing a variable length array of per datum quality control, diagnostic, and data history flags.  

		sources.txt: File containing a variable length array of per datum source archive indicator flags.  

		site_summary.txt: A brief summary file providing geolocation metadata in a simple tab delimited format.  This is entirely redundant with the more comprehensive site metadata files; however, it is provided as a simple easy to use alternative that may be convenient for some users.
